<h4><a href="https://cryptozombies.io/">Cryptozombies!</a></h4>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>Cryptozombies is an amazingly fun, interactive, tutorial website in which you learn about Solidity smart contracts. BY BUILDING A ZOMBIE ARMY!! 🧟🧟‍♀️🧟‍♂️ Okay, sorry for yelling. It is only because I thoroughly enjoyed this website and I think it is a great introduction to the world of Solidity. Go see for yourselves and let me know what you think!</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/simple-nft-marketplace">AWS NFT Simple Marketplace</a></h4>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>A introduction to creating a nft marketplace. The creator warns this code should not be used as production code because it is unfinished. It is a project to give you an example of how you could design such a system.</p>

<p>None of this would be possible without the love and support of my wife Sam and our dog Teddy. Thank you to my nephew Mitchell for letting me help him with his homework, and through that, discover my love of computer science. The wonderful folks at the Vanderbilt Owen School of Engineering Bootcamp. All the Instructors, TA's, Graders, Tutors, and Admin team who made my journey possible. Also to all the coders out there who teach me something new everyday, through Slack, StackOverflow, GitHub, Dev, Codecademy, Coursera, CodeNewbie, Udemy, Dataquest, and too many others to name here. I am grateful for the knowledge freely given, and I will freely give knowledge in return. Thank you most of all, to <strong><em>YOU</em></strong> for reading this far! <strong>👏 🤣</strong></p>
